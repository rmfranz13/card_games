# card_games

This repository is intended to implement algorithms simulating card games using Python. These can be used to play the actual games or to conduct research on game play through simulation, for example, finding the likelihood of certain outcomes in poker.

Another goal is implementing and training neural network which will learn to play the games intelligently, and perhaps find new strategies.
